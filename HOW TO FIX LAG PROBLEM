FIXING THE EVER PRESENT LAGGY HEARTHSTONE CLIENT WHEN USING HDT

THIS IS HOW YOU FIX THAT ISSUE:

ways to fix laggy game client when using HDT:





OPTION 1 (this option didn't work for me, but other people said it worked for them. option 2 worked for me)

make your log.config file into read only

GO TO
C:\Users\>>>>>>YOUR COMPUTER'S NAME HERE<<<<\AppData\Local\Blizzard\Hearthstone

C:\Users\\AppData\Local\Blizzard\Hearthstone 
(copy and paste into file explorer and put your computers name in where i said or just find it using your brain and computer knowledge)

THEN DO THIS:

right click on log.config
press properties
tick read only
press apply and okay

(TO EDIT THIS FILE IN FUTURE UNTICK READ ONLY)

DONE

if that didn't work try this






OPTION 2 (this is the option that worked for me)

make your game run at a higher frame rate. e.g. 60fps 120fps 144fps.
(since the game becomes choppy, simulating 5-10fps while the problem exists. why not increase the fps to compensate for the problem)
(60, 120, 144 are common fps people use. if 60 doesn't work. try 120. if 120 doesnt work try 144. and so on)

HERE IS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:

go here:
C:\Users\>>>>>>YOUR COMPUTER'S NAME HERE<<<<\AppData\Local\Blizzard\Hearthstone 

C:\Users\\AppData\Local\Blizzard\Hearthstone 
(copy and paste into file explorer and put your computers name in where i said or just find it using your brain and computer knowledge)

right click on options.txt
press edit or open with > notepad
scroll to the bottom
underneither the last line of text with no spaces between this and the thing above it write:

copy and paste this into there:

targetframerate:i=60
vsync:b=False
showfps:b=True

(make options.txt a read only file. how to do this is similar to what i said in option 1. right click options.txt > properties>tick readonly>apply>okay)

DONE

this should make your fps 60. it should stop your monitor from affecting a set frame rate and it will show you the fps you are getting.
change 60 to any number you wish



OPTION 3 (shitty option but some people seem to think it works lol. i don't know why but okay.

delete log.config.

don't worry it will come back every single time you play hearthstone. enjoy this shitty fix that doesn't even work. to find it just follow
option 1 and delete it instead of going to properties.....


I HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM FOR MONTHS NOW AND FINALLY FOUND A FIX. YOU NEED TO MAKE THIS MORE OBVIOUS TO PEOPLE THAN IT CURRENTLY IS.
